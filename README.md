DOODLEMON

Version 1.0.0

DOODLEMON is a fan-made collectible card game inspired by the Pokémon Trading Card Game.
Our goal for this project is to learn game design, UI/UX, RNG systems, and full app development while building a fun and interactive card-opening experience.

Current Features (v1.0.0)

In the first official release, we implemented the core systems that make the DOODLEMON experience playable:

Open randomized packs.

Cards are generated using RNG logic with rarity weighting.

✔️ Card Collection

Every card you pull is saved in your personal collection.

Cards use borrowed artwork during prototyping.

✔️ Social Hub

View other players and interact with the community.

✔️ Settings Menu

Customize your app experience (music, avatar, name, etc.)

✔️ Additional Gameplay & UI Features

Smooth animations

Organized card database and models




Upcoming Features / Future Plans

We have several major features planned for future releases:

🎨 Original Artwork

We currently use third-party artwork only for practice.

Our long-term goal is to design original DOODLEMON creatures, art, and card templates.
